    <strong>TLDR;</strong> it's a scavenger hunt. Your team will get clues via SMS or

    to <a href="mailto:companytrip@foursquare.com">companytrip@foursquare.com</a>.
    Have fun, but <strong>don't miss the bus back</strong>!

    This Scavenger Hunt will cover historic and modern points of interest in Old San
    Juan!
  </p>
  <p>
    Things to pack for the hunt: hat, sun block, water, comfortable walking shoes, phone/camera.
  </p>
  <p>
    Upon arrival in Old Town, we'll be at
    <a href="https://foursquare.com/v/plaza-colon/4bc4eb636c6f9c74d2b5b3fc" target="_blank">Plaza Colon</a>.
    Check into the plaza on Swarm using your personal Foursquare account --
    <strong>AFTER</strong> you have <a href="/login">logged in to this site</a> and
    <a href="/profile">updated your phone number</a>
    -- and you'll begin receiving your team's clues via SMS! Check into venues as you discover them to
    uncover your next clues. You can also see a list of all the clues you've uncovered <a href="/progress">
    on this site at any time</a> in case you don't get the text or forget what the clue was.
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    We'll be in Old Town for 2.5 hours. Use as little or as much time to complete the hunt as your team would like,
    timing does not affect scoring. But, <strong>do not miss the 5:30pm bus or your
    team will be disqualified and you'll need to find your own transportation back to the hotel</strong>.
